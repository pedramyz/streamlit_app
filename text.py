###### **Terra**

Terra is an open-source blockchain payment platform for an algorithmic stablecoin, which are cryptocurrencies that automatically track the price of currencies or other assets. The Terra blockchain enables users to instantly spend, save, trade, or exchange Terra stablecoins.

The Terra protocol creates stablecoins designed to consistently track the price of a fiat currency (a government-backed currency such as the U.S. dollar or euro). It consists of two cryptocurrency tokens—Terra and Luna.

###### **What Is Station On Terra?**

Station is an interchain wallet that simplifies the often complex, cumbersome process of interacting with multiple blockchain networks. With Station, users can easily stake, vote, send and receive tokens, and interact with their favorite dApps across all supported chains.

### Perks

### Staking Made Simple

One of the challenges for users looking to participate in proof-of-stake (PoS) networks is the process of selecting a validator to delegate their stake to. With many options available, it can be difficult to discern which one is suitable. Many users try to circumvent this burden and elect to stake to the first validator in the list, effectively contributing towards further network centralization, whether or not that’s their goal.

Enter Quick Stake. This feature streamlines the staking process across all Station-supported chains by automatically selecting and staking to a validator based on specific pre-disclosed criteria, such as voting power and historical performance. All users must do is choose their preferred chain and the amount they desire to stake — Station handles the rest.

### Interchain Governance

The Governance hub on Station allows users to view and vote on proposals for all supported chains in one convenient location. This saves users time by eliminating the need to switch between different interfaces or platforms to stay updated on proposals for various networks.

The Governance hub on Station has four tabs — Voting, Deposit, Passed, and Rejected:

- **Voting**: displays proposals that are live in a voting period

- **Deposit**: displays proposals that are currently in the deposit period and not yet live for voting

- **Passed**: displays proposals that have received enough support from the relevant community to have been approved

- **Rejected**: displays proposals that have not received enough support and have been rejected by the relevant community

Users can toggle between these tabs to explore the statuses of different proposals and stay informed on the governance processes of their preferred chains.

### Crypto Asset Management

Managing and tracking a crypto portfolio can be a daunting task, especially if you’re using multiple wallets or chains. However, it doesn’t have to be. With Station’s user-friendly interface and clear organization of assets, it’s easy to keep track of assets and make informed decisions. For example, add new tokens, monitor your portfolio at a glance, or send and receive tokens quickly across chains using Station’s pop-out sidebar wallet.

In addition, non-custodial wallets like Station offer several benefits that their centralized custodial counterparts can’t — one of which is complete control over funds. With a custodial wallet, users must trust the organization holding their funds to properly secure them and follow withdrawal best practices. However, there have been several incidents of custodial wallet providers suffering from security breaches or experiencing financial difficulties, translating to the loss or theft of user funds.

Non-custodial wallets, on the other hand, allow users to hold their private keys and manage their own funds. This means that users have sole control over their funds and are not dependent on a third party to access or remove them. In today’s current environment, with cases of custodial fraud exposing the underlying risks of centralized exchanges, the importance of non-custodial wallets has become even more evident. Station’s decentralized, non-custodial interchain wallet allows users to manage their funds directly at the wallet level, providing them with peace of mind and total control over their assets.

- Number of Liquidity Pool Transactions increased from 620 to almost double with 1122 transactions

- Number of Liquidity Pool Users increased from 344 to 560 Users

- Volume of LP Transactions drastically increased from 8.93M\$ to almost triple the amount 23.56M\$

- Number of Stake Transactions increased from 4850 to 6751

- Number of Stake Users increased from 3431 to 4563

- Total Volume Of Stake Transactions drastically increased from 1.31M\$ to almost 6 times the amount 6.25M\$

Daily_Metrics = """
Number of Users, Transactions, Daily average Transaction Fees, New Wallets created have all increased on the day of Station Launch ( Jan 14 ) and the day after but fell the following days until Jan 18 where we witness a consistent rise with only some minor falls till today. However number of new wallets created is the exception for this pattern : Number of new wallets created witnesses a drastic rise on Jan 14 but immediately follows a downward pattern until Jan 19. On Jan 20 the trend starts rising again until Jan 22.

Cumulatively speaking the slope of Number of Users and transactions has witnessed the steepest angle on Jan 14 ( Day of Station Launch ) meaning the number of Cumulative users and transactions has been the most on Jan 14 since Jan 1, 2023.

- Number of Transactions was the most on Jan 15 ( The day after station wallet Launch ) with 22.973k total Transactions

- Number of Users on Terra was the most on Jan 15 with 3967 total active users

- Daily average transaction Fees were at their lowest on Jan 12 which is before the launch, then Jan 17 is at second place which is 3 days after launch

- People created the most number of new wallets on Jan 15 with 363 total new wallets created. This is a day after Station wallet launch

**Overall it seems Jan 15, 2023 had the best performance in almost all metrics since Jan 1.  Average transaction fees is the exception though as mentioned before.**

Number of swaps and swappers were at their highest on Jan 15 ( a day after Station launch )

For the distribution of swap amounts before and during the week of launch the overall share of amount ranges are the same for both weeks. However there are some slight changes to the shares :

The 100\$-500\$ range has witnessed a slight increase on the week of station launch from 49.1% of the swap shares up to 52.2% of the shares.

The 10\$-100\$ range has witnessed a slight decrease on the week of station launch from 28.8% of the shares down to 19.6% of the shares.

User_Retention_1 = """
Stickiness ratio is used to measure how often users are returning/interacting to/with a certain chain. It is acquired by dividing the daily active users by monthly active users. In short the higher the stickiness ratio gets, it means the more loyal the users have become. So in simpler terms this chart shows the loyalty of users to Terra block chain by month.

The stickiness ratio has dropped on Oct 1 but then consistently started rising since Nov 1 with a rather sharp rise starting from Dec 1. Terra station launch could be one of the contributing factors to this.

- Generally speaking a stickiness ratio of 25% or higher is considered healthy. Terra even at it’s best months is at 9.19% so far, meaning this block chain has still ways to go to be considered a healthy/successful block chain.
